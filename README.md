Penetration testing is a uniquely challenging job. You are paid to think like a criminal, to use guerilla tactics to your advantage, and to find the weakest links in a highly intricate net of defenses. The things you find can be both surprising and disturbing; penetration tests have uncovered everything from rogue pornography sites to large-scale fraud and criminal activity.


Penetration testing is a way for you to simulate the methods that an attacker might use to circumvent security controls and gain access to an organization’s systems. Penetration testing is more than running scannners and automated tools and then writing a report. And you won’t become an expert penetration tester overnight; it takes years of practice and real-world experience to become proficient.

The Penetration Testing Execution
Standard (PTE)S

Following are the main sections defined by the standard as the basis for penetration testing execution:

    Pre-engagement Interactions
    Intelligence Gathering
    Threat Modeling
    Vulnerability Analysis
    Exploitation
    Post Exploitation
    Reporting

Pre-engagement Interactions
Pre-engagement interactions typically occur when you discuss the scope and terms
of the penetration test with your client. It is critical during pre-engagement
that you convey the goals of the engagement. This stage also serves as your
opportunity to educate your customer about what is to be expected from a
thorough, full-scope penetration test—one without restrictions regarding what
can and will be tested during the engagement.

Intelligence Gathering
In the intelligence gathering phase, you will gather any information you can
about the organization you are attacking by using social-media networks,
Google hacking, footprinting the target, and so on. One of the most impor-
tant skills a penetration tester can have is the ability to learn about a target,
including how it behaves, how it operates, and how it ultimately can be attacked.
The information that you gather about your target will give you valuable
insight into the types of security controls in place

    
    
  In some cases, it might make sense to run very noisy scans from an entirely different IP
range other than the one you will be using for the main attack. This will help you deter-
mine how well the organization responds to the tools you are using.

Threat Modeling
Threat modeling uses the information you acquired in the intelligence-gathering
phase to identify any existing vulnerabilities on a target system. When perform-
ing threat modeling, you will determine the most effective attack method,
the type of information you are after, and how the organization might be
attacked. Threat modeling involves looking at an organization as an adversary
and attempting to exploit weaknesses as an attacker would.


Vulnerability Analysis
Having identified the most viable attack methods, you need to consider how
you will access the target. During vulnerability analysis, you combine the infor-
mation that you’ve learned from the prior phases and use it to understand
what attacks might be viable. Among other things, vulnerability analysis takes
into account port and vulnerability scans, data gathered by banner grabbing,
and information collected during intelligence gathering.
